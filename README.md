### Poetry

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc
</p>
</details>

## Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish ðŸ™‚ `poetry publish --build`


## Installation

```bash
pip install -U sparrow-datums
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add sparrow-datums
```

Then you can run

```bash
sparrow-datums --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run sparrow-datums --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/sparrowml/sparrow-datums/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/sparrowml/sparrow-datums/tree/master/docker).

</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
